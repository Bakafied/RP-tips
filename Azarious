What can you hear from what is going on.
Finally smell what can you you describe it as strong weak etc.

2nd rule use all 3 learning styles visial auditory and kinesthetic This is more advanced than you think first hand how do these 3 effect you in the world what can you see as you walk down the street up the river through the mountain what does the environmental feel like how does it go back to your senses what can you hear how does it sound and etc

3rd rule The final rule is Enjoy the roleplay don’t rush it like something that is supposed to be executed in one day go absolutely ham with your details it’s not a competition but it can be hehe or just a casual rp nothing spicy just holding hands or fighting ( sparring ) it’s suppose to be between to like minded people.
